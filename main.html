	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is the time taken by program to execute the task .we have to focus on make the Time complexity efficient so that program take less Time to execute</p>
		<p>  <bold> Space Complexity  </bold>  is the space required by the program to perform the task ex if the program execute for n time using the loop then the Time Complexity is O(n) </p>
